## Rotation 1 - Fluidized Bed

### Objective

Your objective is to make measurements of pressure across the particle bed vs. flow rate (measured by the rotameters) at a range of flow rates covering the packed bed flow regime. You may use the Bayens- Geldart empirical correlation to estimate the minimum fluidization velocity to ensure that your experimental conditions remain in the packed bed regime.

- Verify that the pressure decreases linearly across the powder column for each condition.
- Compare your data to the Ergun equation and the Carman- Kozeny equation for flow through a packed bed
